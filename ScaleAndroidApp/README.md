# Android App Inventor 2
The android app is responsible to communicate and interact with the Scale and to send its data to the Node-Red Server.
The app was made on the App Inventor tool (http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/) which is an online IDE to easily create Android APPs.
Unfortunately, it does not export its source code. But it generates and .aia file which can then be uploaded back to the tool so that other developer can see the code and reuse it.
